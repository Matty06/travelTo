                Prague is the capital and largest city in the Czech Republic, the 13th
                largest city in European Union. Situated on the Vltava river, Prague is home 
                to about 1.3 million people, while its metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of 2.7 million.
                The city has a temperate oceanic climate, with relatively warm summers and chilly winters.

                <br>
                Prague is a political, cultural and economic centre of central Europe complete with a rich history. 
                Founded during the Romanesque and flourishing by the Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque eras, 
                Prague was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the main residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably 
                of Charles IV (r. 1346â€“1378). It was an important city to the Habsburg Monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
                The city played major roles in the Bohemian and Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War and in 20th-century history 
                as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the World Wars and the post-war Communist era.
